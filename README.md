# streamdeck
Killin's version of the support streamdeck profiles

# Notes
The "Standup" action on the home screen is linked to the Calendar zoom meeting. If you PM reuses the same Zoom meeting then you can double click on "Standup", and then click on "System: Website Open zoom", then past your teams zoom meeting in to the URL field at the bottom of the screen.

I also have that same action set my Slack Status via Zapier. If you setup a webhook zap that sets your Slack status then you can add that webhook to the URL of the "System: Website Set Slack Status" to get that running to.

# Trello
For the Approve Stating and Production actions you will want to make sure that you've put your curser in the Comment field of the card before you push the button on your streamdeck.

For the "Needs Changes" action you will want to make sure that you don't have an active curser anywhere in the Trello card.

# Zendesk
The only thing to make note of here is the "Bug" action. That action just enters `;bug` in for me, which triggers an aText that brings up a form that I fill out for bugs. If you want the aText let me know, or if you have your own you can change the text in that action to trigger that aText for you.

# Chrome
I have a custom URL entered in for Screensteps that pulls up the support articles that are waiting for me to review them. If you don't check support articles that need review then you can probably delete that action.
